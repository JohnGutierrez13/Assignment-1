        <p>Lions prey mostly on grazing or browsing animals such as zebra, various species of antelope or even wildebeest. The entire animal is consumed except for the largest bones. Like all cats, lions have specialized tongues with sharp, rasping structures called papillae. These are used to clean bits of meat off of bones, as well as for grooming. Lions are strict carnivores; however, a steady diet of pure meat does not constitute a balanced diet. Lions receive additional nutrients by consuming organs, such as the liver and kidneys, and smaller bones, as well as by eating the prey’s digestive tract.</p>
        <p>Lions gitare large cats with short, golden brown coats. Their long tails typically have a tuft of black hair at the end. Their weights range from about 250 pounds for females to about 450 pounds for males. Lengths range from 5 to 7 feet, with an extra 2 to 3 feet of tail.</p>
        <p>The jaws are exceptionally powerful, with robust incisors for maintaining a grip on struggling prey that may be larger than the lion itself. The rear teeth are few in number and have a specialized structure, called carnassial teeth, which work like scissors to slice through tough muscle, hide or connective tissue.</p>
        <p>African lions can run up to 37 miles per hour and can tackle prey that greatly outweighs them. Lions are sexually dimorphic. In addition to the weight differences between males and females, males have large manes. Manes start to grow when young males are approximately one year of age and grow thicker, longer, and darker as a male matures. Males generally have a full mane by 4 to 6 years of age. In addition to serving as a visual signal to other lions about the physical status of a male, the thick mane around the throat also protects males from the bites of rival males during male–male combat for territories or mates. </p> <br>
